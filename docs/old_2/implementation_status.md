## UI Manager & CLI Connector Integration Plan (2025-05-05)

Based on code review, the following integration steps are proposed:

1.  **`UIManager` Definition:**
    *   Define the `UIManager` struct in `crates/gini-core/src/ui_bridge/manager.rs`.
    *   Implement `KernelComponent` trait for `UIManager`.
    *   Include methods like `async fn register_connector(&self, connector: Arc&lt;dyn UiConnector&gt;)` to manage connector registration and handle incoming messages.

2.  **`UIManager` Integration into `Application` (`bootstrap.rs`):**
    *   In `crates/gini-core/src/kernel/bootstrap.rs` (`Application::new`):
        *   Instantiate `UIManager`.
        *   Wrap in `Arc::new()`.
        *   Register with `DependencyRegistry` via `registry.register_instance()`.
        *   Add `TypeId::of::&lt;UIManager&gt;()` to `component_init_order`.

3.  **`CliConnector` Definition:**
    *   Define the `CliConnector` struct in `crates/gini/src/cli_connector.rs`.
    *   Implement the (to-be-defined) `UiConnector` trait from `gini-core` for sending messages to `UIManager`.

4.  **`CliConnector` Integration into `main.rs`:**
    *   In `crates/gini/src/main.rs` (`main` function):
        *   Instantiate `CliConnector` after `Application` creation.
        *   Retrieve `UIManager`: `let ui_manager = app.get_component::&lt;UIManager&gt;().await.expect("UIManager not found");`.
        *   Register connector: `ui_manager.register_connector(Arc::new(cli_connector)).await;`.
        *   Run the `CliConnector`'s input loop concurrently or before `app.run()`.
