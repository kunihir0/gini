# Gini Project Documentation

## Project Architecture Overview

Gini is a Rust-based application utilizing a modular, plugin-driven architecture. This documentation provides comprehensive insights into the codebase structure, component relationships, and extension patterns.

### Core Components

1. **Kernel System**
   - Bootstrap mechanism
   - Component management
   - Error handling

2. **Plugin System**
   - Dynamic loading of plugins
   - Version compatibility checking
   - Dependency resolution
   - Conflict detection

3. **Event System**
   - Event dispatching
   - Event management
   - Event types and handlers

4. **Stage Manager**
   - Pipeline execution
   - Plugin lifecycle management
   - Dependency resolution

5. **Storage System**
   - Configuration management
   - Local storage providers
   - Data persistence

6. **UI Bridge**
   - Messaging system
   - Interface abstraction
   - UI event handling

7. **Utility Libraries**
   - File system utilities
   - Path management
   
### Module Relationships

The application follows a layered architecture with:

- Main application entry point (`gini`)
- Core library (`gini-core`) containing the main application logic
- Plugin interfaces and implementations

### Documentation Structure

- `docs/` - Contains various design documents, guides, and analyses (e.g., `plugin_development_guide.md`, `error_handling.md`). API documentation (if auto-generated by `cargo doc`) would typically be in `target/doc/`.
- `docs/tracker.txt` - Documentation progress tracking for source code files.
- Summary files for source code modules and individual files are located in `docs/module_summaries/` and `docs/file_reviews/` respectively.

## Documentation Standards

Each module documentation includes:
- Overall Assessment
- Key Findings
- Recommendations

This documentation helps developers understand, maintain, and extend the application with confidence.
