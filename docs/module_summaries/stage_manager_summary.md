# Stage Manager Module Summary

## Overview

The Stage Manager module provides a robust framework for organizing, sequencing, and executing operations within the Gini application. It implements a stage-based architecture that allows complex workflows to be broken down into discrete, reusable units of work that can be arranged into pipelines with explicit dependency relationships. This system enables flexible composition of operations while ensuring proper execution order, error handling, and context sharing.

## Key Components

### Core Abstractions

1. **Stage Trait (`mod.rs`)**
   - Defines the fundamental contract that all stages must implement
   - Specifies methods for identification, execution, and dry-run support
   - Provides an async execution model compatible with Tokio
   - Enables standardized error handling through boxed error returns

2. **Stage Context (`context.rs`)**
   - Implements a shared state container passed between stages
   - Provides type-safe storage and retrieval of arbitrary data
   - Manages execution mode (live vs. dry run)
   - Stores configuration and CLI argument information

3. **Stage Result (`mod.rs`)**
   - Represents outcomes of stage execution (success, failure, skipped)
   - Provides context for failure and skip conditions
   - Implements display formatting for reporting
   - Enables conditional pipeline execution

### Operational Components

4. **Stage Manager (`manager.rs`)**
   - Orchestrates the overall stage system
   - Handles stage registration and lookup
   - Creates and validates pipelines
   - Executes stages and pipelines
   - Implements the `KernelComponent` trait for lifecycle integration

5. **Stage Registry (`registry.rs`)**
   - Maintains collection of available stages
   - Provides thread-safe stage access through `SharedStageRegistry`
   - Handles stage lookup by ID
   - Executes individual stages with proper context

6. **Stage Pipeline (`pipeline.rs`)**
   - Represents an ordered sequence of stages
   - Handles dependency-based execution ordering
   - Validates stage existence and dependency cycles
   - Manages execution results from multiple stages

### Support Systems

7. **Dependency System (`dependency.rs`)**
   - Implements graph-based dependency representation
   - Handles topological sorting for execution order
   - Detects and reports circular dependencies
   - Validates dependency satisfaction

8. **Error Handling (`error.rs`)**
   - Defines specialized error types for stage operations
   - Provides context-rich error messages
   - Enables error propagation to kernel system
   - Handles error source preservation

9. **Requirement System (`requirement.rs`)**
   - Specifies stage requirements and capabilities
   - Manages optional vs. required dependencies
   - Tracks stage provision information
   - Enables dependency validation

10. **Dry Run Support (`dry_run.rs`)**
    - Implements simulation capabilities for operations
    - Provides dry-run reporting and operation description
    - Estimates resource usage for operations
    - Enables pre-execution validation

11. **Core Stages (`core_stages.rs`)**
    - Provides standard stages for common operations
    - Implements plugin lifecycle stages
    - Demonstrates stage implementation patterns
    - Provides foundational functionality for pipelines

## Architectural Patterns

### Stage Lifecycle

The stage system implements a comprehensive lifecycle:

1. **Registration**: Stages are registered with the manager
2. **Discovery**: Stages are looked up by ID when needed
3. **Dependency Resolution**: Dependencies between stages are resolved
4. **Pipeline Creation**: Stages are organized into execution pipelines
5. **Validation**: Pipeline structure and dependencies are validated
6. **Execution**: Stages are executed in dependency order
7. **Result Collection**: Results from each stage are aggregated

### Context Sharing

The context-based design enables several patterns:

1. **Shared State**: Stages can share data without direct coupling
2. **Type-Safe Access**: Data is stored and retrieved with type safety
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Stages can build upon data from previous stages
4. **Execution Control**: Context determines execution mode (live/dry-run)

### Dependency Management

The dependency system enables sophisticated workflow composition:

1. **Explicit Dependencies**: Stages declare their dependencies on other stages
2. **Topological Sorting**: Execution order is derived from dependencies
3. **Cycle Detection**: Circular dependencies are detected and reported
4. **Requirement Validation**: Required stages are verified before execution

### Pipeline Execution

The pipeline system manages stage execution with several features:

1. **Ordered Execution**: Stages are executed in dependency order
2. **Error Handling**: Errors from individual stages are properly propagated
3. **Result Collection**: Results from all stages are collected and returned
4. **Dry Run Support**: Pipelines can be validated without side effects

## Integration Points

The Stage Manager integrates with several other components:

1. **Kernel System**:
   - Implements `KernelComponent` for lifecycle integration
   - Reports errors through kernel error system
   - Participates in application initialization and shutdown

2. **Plugin System**:
   - Core stages handle plugin lifecycle events
   - Plugins can register custom stages
   - Stage registry is accessible to plugins
   - Plugin dependencies can be expressed through stages

3. **Configuration System**:
   - Stages access configuration through context
   - Pipeline definitions can be loaded from configuration
   - Configuration paths are managed through context

4. **UI System**:
   - Stages can report progress through UI components
   - Pipeline execution results can be displayed
   - Error messages can be presented to users

## Security Considerations

The Stage Manager implements several security measures:

1. **Validation**: Pipeline structure and dependencies are validated before execution
2. **Type Safety**: Context data access enforces type safety
3. **Error Isolation**: Errors in one stage don't affect others
4. **Resource Control**: Dry run mode allows resource usage estimation

## Extensibility

The system is designed for extensibility:

1. **Custom Stages**: New stages can be added without modifying existing code
2. **Pipeline Composition**: Stages can be arranged into arbitrary pipelines
3. **Dependency Specification**: Custom dependencies can be defined
4. **Context Extension**: New data types can be stored in context

## Testing Approach

The Stage Manager can be tested at multiple levels:

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual stages and components can be tested in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Stage sequences can be tested together
3. **Dry Run Testing**: Operations can be validated without side effects
4. **Mock Stages**: Test stages can verify system behavior

## Future Directions

Potential enhancements for the Stage Manager include:

1. **Parallel Execution**: Independent stages could be executed concurrently
2. **Stage Versioning**: Version compatibility could be managed
3. **Persistent Pipelines**: Pipeline definitions could be stored and loaded
4. **Progress Reporting**: More sophisticated progress tracking
5. **Recovery Mechanisms**: Better handling of partial failures

## Conclusion

The Stage Manager provides a robust foundation for organizing complex workflows in the Gini application. Its stage-based architecture enables modular, reusable operations that can be composed into sophisticated processing pipelines with explicit dependencies. The system's focus on validation, error handling, and context sharing creates a reliable framework for executing operations in the correct order with proper data flow between components.
