## Current Status

Phase 1 of the project is complete! We have successfully implemented and subsequently refactored the core infrastructure components:

1. **Kernel Infrastructure**
   - Component-based architecture implemented
   - Asynchronous operations using Tokio runtime integrated
   - Core error handling system
   - Bootstrap application
   - Configuration constants

2. **Plugin System**
   - Version management
   - Dependency resolution
   - Plugin trait definitions
   - Plugin registry
   - Plugin manifest handling
   - Adapter system for plugin interoperability
   - Conflict resolution

3. **Stage Manager**
   - Stage trait definitions
   - Stage context
   - Stage registry
   - Pipeline execution
   - Requirements
   - Dry run functionality
   - Dependency resolver

4. **Storage Management**
   - Storage provider interface
   - Local filesystem implementation
   - Flexible abstraction layer

5. **Event System**
   - Event dispatcher
   - Standard event types
   - Event queue management

6. **UI Bridge**
   - Message system
   - Provider interface
   - Basic console provider

7. **Utility Functions**
   - Filesystem utilities
   - Path handling functions

## Next Steps
