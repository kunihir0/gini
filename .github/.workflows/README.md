# GitHub Actions Workflows Documentation

This document outlines the GitHub Actions workflows that should be implemented for this project's CI/CD pipeline.

## CI Workflow (ci.yml)

This workflow handles continuous integration tasks including linting, testing, and building the application.

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, dev, staging]
  push:
    branches: [main, dev, staging]

jobs:
  lint-test-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Bun
        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
        with:
          bun-version: latest

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: Lint
        run: bun run lint
        # Note: Add a lint script to package.json first

      - name: Test
        run: bun run test
        # Note: Add a test script to package.json first

      - name: Build
        run: bun run build
```

## Deployment Workflow (deploy.yml)

This workflow handles automatic deployment to different environments based on the branch.

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [dev, staging, main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Setup Bun
        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
        with:
          bun-version: latest
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install --frozen-lockfile
        
      - name: Build
        run: bun run build
        
      - name: Deploy to appropriate environment
        run: |
          if [[ $GITHUB_REF == 'refs/heads/main' ]]; then
            # Deploy to production
            echo "Deploying to production"
            # Add your production deployment commands here
          elif [[ $GITHUB_REF == 'refs/heads/staging' ]]; then
            # Deploy to staging
            echo "Deploying to staging"
            # Add your staging deployment commands here
          else
            # Deploy to dev environment
            echo "Deploying to development"
            # Add your development deployment commands here
          fi
```

## Implementation Instructions

To implement these workflows:

1. Switch to Code mode in the Cline interface
2. Create the files `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the content above
3. Adjust the workflows as needed for your specific deployment requirements
4. Add necessary lint and test scripts to your package.json file
